## Description
> This project allows the user to manage a full database of employees from the command line. By running the application, a menu appears that gives you multiple options on how to manage the database. The user can view employees based on their selected criteria, along with adding, removing, or updating employee information,role information, or department information. The database dynamically updates within the command line, so the user can view their changes in the command line immediately after inputting them.
